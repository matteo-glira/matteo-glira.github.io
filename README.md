### ABOUT ℹ️
Hey there! I'm Matteo Glira, a passionate explorer of the mysteries of the universe 🚀. Quantum mechanics and general relativity are my playgrounds, and I'm always diving into the depths of quantum computing.

I've been coding since childhood, mastering languages like Python and web development along the way. Oh, and did I mention I have a soft spot for cars? 🚗💨

### WORK 💼
