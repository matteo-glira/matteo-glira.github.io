### ABOUT
Hi, I'm Matteo Glira.
I have a strong passion for physics, especially quantum mechanics, and I enjoy exploring concepts such as quantum computing and general relativity.
I've been coding since I was young, and now I'm skilled in various programming languages like Python and web development.
And well … I like cars ;)
